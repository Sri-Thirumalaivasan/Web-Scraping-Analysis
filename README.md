# Web-Scrapping-Analysis

# Web Scraping and Machine Learning Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline using web scraping, data preprocessing, machine learning, and database storage.

## Technologies Used
- Web Scraping: Selenium
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- Database: SQLAlchemy (SQLite)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure and Components

1.Web Scraping (scraper.py):
- Uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome
- Scrapes job listings from Indeed.com
- Extracts job title, company, location
- Supports multiple keywords and locations
- Implements random delays to avoid rate limiting
- Logs scraping activities


2.Data Preprocessing (preprocessor.py):
- Cleans and transforms scraped data
- Removes duplicates
- Encodes categorical variables
- Performs feature engineering
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict job availability


3.Database Storage (database_storage.py):
- Uses SQLAlchemy with SQLite
- Creates an ORM model for job listings
- Supports inserting and querying job data
- Provides methods for database interactions


4.Main Pipeline (main.py):
- Orchestrates the entire data engineering workflow
- Runs web scraping, preprocessing, ML model training
- Stores data in database
- Generates visualizations
- Implements comprehensive logging

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Detailed Implementation Steps
- Web scraping from job portal
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning model for job market prediction
- SQLite database storage
- Performance metrics and visualizations

## Ethical Considerations
- Adherence to website's robots.txt
- Respectful scraping practices
- No personal or sensitive data collection
